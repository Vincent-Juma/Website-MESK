            UQCS is a student society, run by students, for students. We engage with a broad range of student interests,
            from digital design to software engineering. We're an inclusive club focused on developing the next
            generation of innovators, through twice-weekly events spanning educational, social, and industry emphases.
            Our membership spans undergraduates, postgraduates, recent graduates, and alumni.
